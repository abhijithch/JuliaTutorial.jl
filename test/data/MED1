fatty acid levels in placenta and fetus. 


ventricular septal defect occurring in association with aortic 
regurgitation. 


radioisotopes in heart scanning.  mainly used in diagnosis of 
pericardial effusions.  also used to study tumors, heart enlargement, 
aneurysms and pericardial thickening.  technetium, rihsa, radioactive

effect of azathioprine on systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly 
in regard to renal lesions. 


bacillus subtilis phages and genetics, with particular reference 
to transduction.

of steroids on this condition.  only the terms kidney diseases and 
nephrotic syndrome were selected by the requester.  prednisone and 
prednisolone are the only steroids of interest. 


homonymous hemianopsia in visual aphasia, particularly 
measurement and assessment.  gerstmann's syndrome and agnosia are also 
of interest. 


separation anxiety in infancy (i.e. up to two years of age) and in 
preschool children, particularly separation of a child from its mother.

with enzyme systems; toxicity of, in humans and laboratory animals; 
deficiency signs and symptoms; level in various foodstuffs; level in 
blood and tissues. 


the toxicity of organic selenium compounds. 


excretion of phosphate or pyrophosphate in the urine or the effect of 
parathyroid hormone on kidney. 


somatotropin as it effects bone, bone development, regeneration, 
resorption, bone cells, osteogenesis, physiologic calcification or 
ossification, cartilage and bone diseases in general.  somatotropin as 
it relates to hypophysectomy, pituitary function, diseases, dwarfism, 
neoplasms, hypopituitarism and hyperpituitarism, and growth in general.

or animal, or in pregnancy, gynecologic diseases, or as related to 
chromosomes or chromosome abnormalities.

(hypertrophy) and cell proliferation (hyperplasia) in the remaining 
kidney following unilateral nephrectomy in mammals. 


use of chlorothiazide (diuril) or hydrochlorothiazide (hydrodiuril) in 
the treatment of nephogenic diabetes insipidus in children; also, 
use of low sodium diets and aldactone (spironolactone) in the treatment 
of childhood nephogenic diabetes insipidus. 


methods for experimental production of and known causes of 
hydrocephalus in animals and humans. 


interested in the parasitic diseases.  filaria parasites found in 
primates, the insect vectors of filaria, the related diptera, i. e., 
culicoides, mosquitos, etc., that may serve as vectors of this 
infection-disease; also the life cycles and transmission of the 
filaria.  parasites and ecology of the taiwan monkey, macaca cyclopis, 
with emphasis on the filarial parasite, macacanema formosana. 


palliation (temporary improvement) of cancer patients by using 
drugs, x-ray, surgery. 


hereditary implications of prolonged neonatal obstructive jaundice 
associated with liver pathology.  there are but two relatively 
common well-defined pathologic entities that present as such:  1) bile 
duct or biliary atresia and 2) giant cell transformation of the liver 
often referred to as neonatal hepatitis.  information regarding 
liver and bile duct embryogenesis will be an important adjunct 
to papers on the disease processes. 


hemophilia and christmas disease, especially in regard to the 
specific complication of pseudotumor formation (occurrence, 
pathogenesis, treatment, prognosis).
